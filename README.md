# Library Management System

## Overview
This project is a Library Management System developed for Akbank Python BootCamp. Implemented in Python using object-oriented programming techniques, the system facilitates efficient management of a library's book inventory. The core functionality revolves around a designated books.txt file that serves as the primary database, with each row representing a different book entry. Basic information such as the book's title, author, publication date, and page count are stored, with each item separated by commas.

## Features
- **Add Books:** Easily add new books to the library database by providing details such as name, author, publication date, and page count.
- **View Books:** View a list of all books in the library with their details.
- **Remove Books:** Remove unwanted books from the library.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/enesbuyuk/library-management-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd library-management-system
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh

## Database Structure
The books.txt file acts as the backbone of the library database. Each line is dedicated to a single book entry, and the details are structured in the following order: title, author, publication date, and pages.
